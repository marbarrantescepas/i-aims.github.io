  <h1>Our Story</h1>

  <p>
    iAIMS began with a simple belief: the future of multiple sclerosis research and care will be shaped by people who understand MS and people who understand artificial intelligence working together, learning from one another, and building solutions side by side.
  </p>

  <p>
    That belief took shape in Barcelona the evening before ECTRIMS 2025. A small group of enthusiastic clinicians and researchers gathered among plants, post-its, and open conversations to imagine what machine learning could mean for MS care. The atmosphere was marked by a genuine willingness to explore ideas together, and that collaborative spirit became the starting point for what would grow into a community.
  </p>

  <h2>How iAIMS Started</h2>

  <p>
    The community was initiated by Dr. Stijn Denissen and Dr. Ceren Tozlu, who both saw the same challenge from different angles. Despite rapid progress in AI research, many innovations struggled to reach clinical practice. The gap was not due to a lack of talent or ideas. It was a lack of shared understanding.
  </p>

  <p>
    They realized that bridging this gap required more than new algorithms. It required a space where clinicians and researchers could learn from each other, explore possibilities, and collaborate in a supportive environment. iAIMS was created to be that space.
  </p>

  <h2>A Community With a Shared Purpose</h2>

  <p>
    iAIMS is an international community dedicated to advancing AI-driven research and care for multiple sclerosis. We welcome clinicians, researchers, engineers, statisticians, and everyone working to understand or improve MS care. People living with MS are the ultimate beneficiaries of this work, and their needs guide our direction.
  </p>

  <p>Our mission is built around three pillars.</p>

  <h3>Unite</h3>
  <p>
    Bring together the diverse ecosystem of AI and MS enthusiasts, from neurologists to data scientists, to foster meaningful collaboration.
  </p>

  <h3>Inform</h3>
  <p>
    Share developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, and create opportunities for bidirectional learning between clinical and technical experts.
  </p>

  <h3>Co-create</h3>
  <p>
    Build open-source code, shared datasets, guidelines, and knowledge repositories that support responsible and effective AI for MS research and care.
  </p>

  <h2>What We Are Building</h2>

  <p>
    In our first year, iAIMS is focused on creating an open and supportive community. We are launching educational events, hackathons, a journal club, and early guidelines for AI use in MS research and clinical workflows.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our opening session in Barcelona on September 2025 marked the beginning of this journey and set the tone for what we aim to build: a collaborative, transparent, and globally accessible community.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Values</h2>

  <p>iAIMS is grounded in principles that guide everything we do.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Transparency</li>
    <li>Open science</li>
    <li>Global equity</li>
    <li>Co-creation between scientists and clinicians</li>
    <li>A commitment to responsible AI, including thoughtful attention to ethics and data governance</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These values ensure that the tools and knowledge we create are trustworthy, accessible, and aligned with the needs of the MS community.
  </p>

  <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

  <p>
    In five years, we envision a world where clinicians and researchers share a common understanding of how to use AI effectively, not as a buzzword but as a practical and reliable part of MS research and care. Our guiding focus is simple: the evolving needs of clinicians and researchers, continuously informed by outreach and real-world experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    The story of iAIMS is still being written. We invite you to join us as we learn, build, and shape the future of AI and MS together.
